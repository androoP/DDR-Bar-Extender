# DDR Bar Extender
A DIY bar extender for Dance Dance Revolution

##DISCLAIMERS
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This bar is sturdy, but I haven't tested it with everyone's unique play styles. If things slip or break, it could cause injury, so play safely and responsibly!**
**As of now, this project has only been tested on a personal machine. Although it has not caused any damage, there's always a chance that it could! Please do not use this on public cabinets!**

## What is this?
As an elderly man who enjoys Dance Dance Revolution, I developed painful tendonitis in my right wrist, due to the game's narrow bar. The solution: Make the bar wider. This project lists all parts and processes needed to make your very own bar extension.

## Purpose
This project exists with the following goals in mind:
- A simple way to raise the DDR bar and/or extend its width
- Non-destructive and easily removable
- Inexpensive with easy-to-find materials
- Portable

## The Solution
Buy a few parts, 3D print a spacer, and slap a sturdy bar extension together.

## The Materials
- 2x Lighting Truss Swivel Coupler https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWLZRMKS - $42
- 1x 2ft 1.25in PVC pipe https://www.homedepot.com/p/Charlotte-Pipe-1-1-4-in-x-2-ft-PVC-DWV-Sch-40-Pipe-PVC-07100-0200/202018045 - $4.37
- 1x 4x40 Non Slip Self Adhesive Silicone: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VFB7QVF - $8
- 1x 3D Printed Bar Spacer (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QP6zy3jlY_8I42tuRGvenI6m6v6fewwe?usp=sharing)
- 2x #10 Screws (At least 2in length)
  - If you have these lying around, no need to buy a whole bunch. Otherwise, these should work: https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Phillips-Screws-Tapping/dp/B0C6LZ8FQC
- (Optional) 2x Charlotte Pipe Caps https://www.homedepot.com/p/Charlotte-Pipe-1-1-4-in-PVC-Schedule-40-Socket-Cap-PVC021161200HD/203811674

## The Process
- Start by taking your PVC pipe and measuring/marking its center point. Although you've purchased a 2ft length, it might not be *exactly* 2ft, so measure the actual length, divide by two, and mark the middle.
- On each side, starting from the center mark, measure out 58mm and mark the two spots.
- 3D Print the spacer. I used 3 wall loops, 15% infill, and suggest something sturdy like PETG.
- Once printed, slide the spacer down the PVC pipe, so each side touches the 58mm marks you made. It should be somewhat tight, but feel free to use a small piece of tape to hold it in place, if needed.
  - The whole measuring process ensures that we're putting our 3D printed spacer as dead-center as we can.
- Take one aluminum coupler and make a note of a small hole, adjacent to one of the clamps. This hole needs to be on the clamp that will attach to your DDR Bar. It should also align with the small screw hole on your spacer.
- Open the clamp on the side that *DOES NOT* have this small hole and snug it up with the spacer as close as you can.
  - Note here: I face the coupler threads *AWAY* from the DDR pad, to avoid scratching myself. I strongly suggest ensuring that both threads are facing away from the play area.
- Make sure the smaller hole on the coupler is aligned with the small hole on our 3D Printed Spacer. 
- Begin clamping the PVC pipe, again making sure to keep the clamp and spacer as close as possible during this process.
- Before we move to using a wrench on the locking nut, make sure everything looks like it's aligned. The spacer should be directly centered with the clamp, and the small hole should be centered with the spacer's screw hole.
- Use a wrench to tighten the nut. It should be tight, but don't overtighten, or you'll crack the PVC. Again, make sure that everything is aligned.
- Take the second coupler and repeat this process, making sure the protruding coupler threads are oriented in the same way as our first.
- Your PVC pipe should now have a spacer sandwich: One coupler, a spacer, and the other coupler. Take your screws and insert them through the small clamp holes, into the spacer.
  - Everything should now be tightly together, with zero give.
